# stageit.com Discuss Their Stack
## Dan Bosan, Nick Messick, stageit.com

We just upgraded our infrastructure to latest Ruby, Postgres, Rails
(3.0 not later than that), Unicorn and switched from Node.js to
Pubnub.

We will discuss our use of Rubber, how we came to those decisions and
the different things we discovered while doing the steps below, as
well as how this has affected our performance in our site.

Thanks!
