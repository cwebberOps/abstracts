# potential-speaker-abstracts

This repo lets us more easily track [LA Dev/Ops](http://meetup.com/ladevops)
talks.

If you're thinking about submitting a talk, create and then send a pull request
with your title and abstract under `/proposals/<your talk>` and an LA DevOp
will contact you.

See the [sample file](https://github.com/ladevops/potential-speaker-abstracts/tree/master/proposals/sample.md) for an example.
