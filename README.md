# LA DevOps upcoming speakers and abstracts 
## because we really want your talk

This repo lets us more easily track [LA Dev/Ops](http://meetup.com/ladevops)
talks.

If you're thinking about submitting a talk, fork this repo, add your abstract and info to `/proposals/<your talk>`, then send a pull request.  An LA DevOp will then schedule and contact you. 

See the [sample file](https://github.com/ladevops/potential-speaker-abstracts/tree/master/proposals/sample.md) for an example.
