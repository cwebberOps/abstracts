Trigger is a robust network engineering toolkit written in Python that was designed for interfacing with network devices and managing network configuration and security policy. It increases the speed and efficiency of managing large-scale networks while reducing the risk of human error.

Started by the AOL Network Security team in 2006, Trigger was originally designed for security policy management on firewalls, routers, and switches. It has since been expanded to be a full-featured network engineering toolkit.

With the high number of network devices on the AOL network this application is invaluable to performance and reliability. We hope you'll find it useful on your network and consider participating!
